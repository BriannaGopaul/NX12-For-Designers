### Day 13: March 24 2021

Tutorial 1: Chapter 6 [in progress]

Stuck on an edge blend, it always looks off from what the model should look like despite me following the instructions. I could just filet the sketch and then extrude it which makes the same result that I need but I want to follow the tutorial's steps. There's clearly something I'm doing wrong and I'm not sure what. Going to keep playing with it.

Struggling with creating a feature on an angled datum plane. The feature is not extruding on an incline despite the datum plane being at a 40 degree angle...I'll figure it out.
